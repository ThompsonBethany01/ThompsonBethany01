## *About Me*
I am currently attending Codeup, a fully-immersive, project-based 22-week Data Science career accelerator.  
I've learned each step of the DS pipeline:  

``` Acquire  -  Prepare  -  Explore  -  Modeling  -  Delivering the Final Product  ```

The data isn't always (-cough- more like never -cough-) easy on the eyes, but I make sure the final project is. I am drawn to the visual side of data, such as creating interactive Tableau Storybooks and presentations that keep the audience drawn in.  

My personal interests include reading a good science fiction book, listening to music, and rollerskating (*very carefully*, knee pads and all). Most importantly, I love being creative in everything possible.
